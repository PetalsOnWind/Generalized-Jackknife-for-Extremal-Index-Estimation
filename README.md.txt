# Extremal Index Estimation by Generalized Jackknife Method

This project replicates the paper ["Subsampling techniques and the Jackknife 
methodology in the estimation of the extremal index"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2007.06.023) by 
M. Ivette Gomes, Andreia Hall, M. Cristina Miranda.

This project was completed as a part of term project for the course 
"Computational Statistics" in Autumn 2020.

##### Discalimer: For educational purpose only. We recommend following the honor code for any submission. 

## How to run the code?
Most of the implementation is done in Jupyter notebooks (often downloaded Google colab).
They can be opened in Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab.

The `final_submission` folder contains the pdf that were finally submitted.
Names of the group members have been removed.

Some code may be missing in notebook files but will be available in pdf version of notebooks.

The `data` folder contains the data for the case studies in the paper. 

## Problems in the current version
Due to time constraints, some of the values for high values of n, such as `n=5000` and 
`n=10,000` have not been stimulated for all the tables.
The figure 11 does not exactly match that in the paper. We are not exactly sure of how
to resolve this problem with subsampling. However, subsampling was not the main objective.
